# react-redux

Dear mentor!

To edit a todo by id from URL, enter it's id after the edit parameter, e.g: http://localhost:3000/#/edit/3
this is an actual todo id so you can test it.

Undo-redo is still messed up when used on toggle, tried to filter some actions from it as the documentation suggested, but just wouldn't work (maybe because the app is stateless...?) => index.js line 17
